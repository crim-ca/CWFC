# Deep learning research project funded by the Canadian Wood Fibre Centre

The main goal of the project was to explore applications of deep learning techniques for the recognition of tree species with high resolution imagery acquired with a drone. As an effort of contribution to the domain, we have decided upfront to make the drone-acquired data as well as the produced orthomosaics available and thus have created this data repository.

## Drone mission
The drone mission took place on Thursday, August 16, 2018, in the regional park of Forêt-Ouareau near the suspension bridge area. Details regarding acquisition and orthomosaic creation are available in the project [final report](CCFB02_Final_Report.pdf)
